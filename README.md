# 2023-24 Jumpstart Swerve Drive Session Example Code

This repository contains example code used in the swerve drive session at Jumpstart.

Note that to use this code you will have to change some things:
- Change the constants in `Constants.java` to match your robot.
- Comment out the appropriate lines in `SwerveModule.java`.
- This code assumes you are either using two CTRE motors with CANCoders or two REV motors with an absolute encoder attached to the data port of the drive motor. If you are not, you will need to change the code yourself to reflect your robot.
